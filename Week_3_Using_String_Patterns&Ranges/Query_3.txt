-- Exercise 1: String Patterns

-- Retrieve all employees whose address is in Elgin,IL.

--select F_NAME, L_NAME FROM EMPLOYEES
--WHERE ADDRESS LIKE '%Elgin,IL%'

-- Retrieve all employees who were born during the 1970's.

--select F_NAME, L_NAME, B_DATE FROM EMPLOYEES
--WHERE B_DATE LIKE '%197__%'

-- Retrieve all employees in department 5 whose salary is 
-- between 60000 and 70000.

--Select F_NAME, L_NAME, SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES
--WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 60000 and 70000

-- Exercise 2: Sorting

-- Retrieve a list of employees ordered by department ID.

--SELECT DEP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME FROM EMPLOYEES
--ORDER BY DEP_ID

-- Retrieve a list of employees ordered in descending order by 
-- department ID and within each department ordered alphabetically 
-- in descending order by last name.

--SELECT DEP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME FROM EMPLOYEES
--ORDER BY DEP_ID DESC, L_NAME DESC

-- In SQL problem 2 (Exercise 2 Problem 2), use department name 
-- instead of department ID. Retrieve a list of employees ordered by 
-- department name, and within each department ordered alphabetically 
-- in descending order by last name.

-- Select DEP.DEP_NAME , EMP.F_NAME, EMP.L_NAME
-- From EMPLOYEES as EMP, DEPARTMENTS as DEP
-- WHERE EMP.DEP_ID = DEP.DEPT_ID_DEP
-- ORDER BY DEP.DEP_NAME, EMP.L_NAME DESC;

-- Exercise 3: Grouping

-- For each department ID retrieve the number 
-- of employees in the department.

--Select DEP_ID, COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEES
--GROUP BY DEP_ID

-- For each department retrieve the number of employees in the department, and the average 
-- employee salary in the department.

--SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*), AVG(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES
--GROUP BY DEP_ID

-- SQL ALIAS
-- Label the computed columns in the result set of SQL problem 2 
-- (Exercise 3 Problem 2) as NUM_EMPLOYEES and AVG_SALARY.

--SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*) as NUM_EMPLOYEES, AVG(SALARY) as AVG_SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES
--GROUP BY DEP_ID

-- (Exercise 3 Problem 3), order the result set by Average Salary.

--SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*) as NUM_EMPLOYEES, AVG(SALARY) as AVG_SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES
--GROUP BY DEP_ID
--ORDER BY AVG_SALARY

--SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*) as NUM_EMPLOYEES, AVG(SALARY) as AVG_SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES
--GROUP BY DEP_ID
--HAVING COUNT(*) < 4
--ORDER BY AVG_SALARY
